# CitySimulation
The growth of car ownership has worsened urban issues, especially in commuter towns reliant on travel to nearby cities. This study develops an Agent-Based Model (ABM) using GAMA to simulate mobility in Legan√©s, Madrid. It integrates official data and proposes a scalable urban simulation framework for future research.
